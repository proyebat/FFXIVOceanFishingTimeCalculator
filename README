You probably play FFXIV if you've found this github.
I bet you probably do things in the game that aren't "complain about shitty healers that don't dps" but are more like "I want to go for that octopus title from that cool new ocean fishing content, but my schedule sucks"

Well good news for you! I have made a basic calculator for finding out what's going to happen on a particular day.


Bad news is that I hate time zones and daylight savings, because I don't like programming around that kind of stuff.
This calculator was made for pacific time zone and I think the times are gonna mess up when daylight savings kicks in soon.
I'll work on a fix for that at some point.
